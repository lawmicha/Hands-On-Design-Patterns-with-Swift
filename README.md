**Master Swift best practices to build modular applications for mobile, desktop, and server platforms**

## What is this book about?
Swift keeps gaining traction not only amongst Apple developers but also as a server-side language. This book demonstrates how to apply design patterns and best practices in real-life situations, whether that's for new or already existing projects.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Work efficiently with Foundation and Swift Standard library
* Understand the most critical GoF patterns and use them efficiently
* Use Swift 4.2 and its unique capabilities (and limitations) to implement and improve GoF patterns
* Improve your application architecture and optimize for maintainability and performance
* Write efficient and clean concurrent programs using futures and promises, or reactive programming techniques

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
func translate(point : Point, dx : Double, dy : Double) {
 point.x += dx
 point.y += dy
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for intermediate developers who want to apply design patterns with Swift to structure and scale their applications. You are expected to have basic knowledge of iOS and Swift.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).

## Get to Know the Authors
**Florent Vilmart**, M.Sc., is a full stack engineer in Montreal. Born in France, he moved to Montreal shortly before graduating, seeking exciting opportunities in the francophone metropole of North America. He honed his skills with Objective-C before jumping to Swift when it was released. He is a polyglot, and you can find his open source work on the parse community GitHub project, where he is one of the core maintainers. He has spoken at conferences, including the GitHub CodeConf in 2016 and, most recently, the 2017 Swift Summit in San Francisco. Currently, he is working full-time with BusBud in Montreal, using mainly TypeScript alongside Swift.

**Giordano Scalzo** is a developer with 20 years of programming experience, since the days of the ZX-Spectrum. He has worked in C++, Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, and in a multitude of other languages. After years of backend development, Giordano has developed extensively for iOS, releasing more than 20 apps which he wrote for clients, enterprise applications, or for his own benefit. Currently, he is a contractor in London where, through his company, Effective Code Ltd., he delivers code for iOS. For Packt, he has written two books on Swift, Swift by Example and Swift 2 by Example, and has reviewed a number of Swift books and videos, including Learn Swift by Building Applications, Introduction to Server-Side Swift, and Swift Functional Programming.

**Sergio De Simone** has been working as a software engineer for over twenty years across a range of different projects and companies, including work environments such as Siemens, HP, and small start-ups. For the last few years, his focus has been on developing mobile platforms and related technologies. He is currently working for BigML, Inc., where he leads iOS and OS X development. Additionally, he likes writing about technology, as well as programming tools, techniques, and languages, with a special focus on Swift evolution, for InfoQ.
